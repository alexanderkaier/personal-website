Welcome! I am a Bioinformatician who is interested in multi-omics approaches and selection theory to help develop the crops we eat tomorrow. My current focus lies on the illumination of the biochemical processes underlying heat and drought stress in potato plants.

Besides my research, I am passionate about statistics, mathematics and philosophy and love to think about the nature and boundaries of human knowledge, the role of mathematics in the sciences and new ways to look at the world.

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to know more about evolutionary theory, molecular breeding approaches, statistical analysis or if you are interested in a collaboration.

[//]: # (One of my idols, the great french mathematician Henri Poincaré, has once been described as follows: "He took up new interests, but seldom dropped any". In that regard, I feel very much connected to him. I am frequently switching between my .)
